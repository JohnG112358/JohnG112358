# About Me
Hello! I’m John, a junior at Dartmouth College majoring in computer science and minoring in Chinese. I’m passionate about all things AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity, with interests ranging from software vulnerabilities/exploitation and security in the smart home to AI development and assured AI. I aspire to be at the forefront of building the technologies of tomorrow and ensuring that they are safe, secure, and trustworthy.

Outside of CS, I enjoy working with youth. I've been involved with tutoring and mentoring nonprofits since high school, most recently leading lessons in under-resourced schools to teach coding. In my free time, I enjoy reading, running, weight lifting, and learning about current events.
